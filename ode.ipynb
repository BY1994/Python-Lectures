    "# Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will work with a few numerical methods to try to solve and characterize ODEs. Since we do not want to solve ODEs explicitly, we first need an algorithm that can tackle this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most simple method is **Euler's method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler's method \n",
    "For this method, we start by remembering the definition of the derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(t_0) = \\lim_{dt\\to 0} \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, approximately (without the limit), the derivative of a function at a point t0 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(t_0) \\approx \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a first order ODE is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df(t)}{dt} = f'(t) = g(f(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, actually, in an ODE we know that the derivative of a function is equal to some other (complex) function of that function $g(f(t))$. Combining the two equations, we get for a specific point $t_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(f(t_0)) = \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And, solving for $f(t_0+dt)$, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t_0+dt) = g(f(t_0))*dt + f(t_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an iterative algorithm that allows us to move the solution to the equation a little step $dt$ forward, given that we can evaluate $g(f(t_0))$ and $f(t_0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know $g(f(t_0))$, but we do NOT know $f(t_0)$ in general. Therefore, in order to solve this, we need to start at a certain point, which is determined by the initial conditions (also sometimes called boundary conditions). This is necessary for solving ANY ODE!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for a certain point $t_0$, we need to know the value of the function at that point\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t_0)=x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a simple example first. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to integrate the standard equation that gives us the exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{dt} = f(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the derivative of the function $f(t)$ is the function itself. \n",
